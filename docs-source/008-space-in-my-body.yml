description: This was a really fun sketch to develop. It is heavily influenced by one of my favorite artists on Instagram, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/jetsyart/'>jetsyart</a>. They do not use generative methods but I find their asthetic to be very inspirational. My version is based on a pointillism concept and relatively simple, but I was happy with how it turned out.

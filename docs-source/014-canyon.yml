  This is my very first 3D render ever! I followed
  <a href="https://youtu.be/AMTglCOvKI8" target="_blank">this youtube tutorial</a>
  to a T because I've never used Blender before and I didn't know what I was doing,
  so my result looks basically identical to what the author created in the video.
  Regardless, it was a fun experiment and I hope to do more explorations of Blender soon!

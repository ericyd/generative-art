  This design is several months in the making.
  Which is to say, I started this design a few months ago and then I'd spend about 5 minutes every week tinkering with it.
  I almost gave up on it several times but I'm so happy I didn't because it became one of my favorite series I've worked on.
  My initial concept was inspired by images of our galaxy, and some of the final renders evoke a galactic sentiment.
  But the aesthetic that I appreciated even more was the fine, sand-like texture of the shapes. It reminded me of sand dunes
  undulating and growing and eroding over time.

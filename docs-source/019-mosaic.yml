  My goal with this was to create a pointillism piece where no natural unfilled space existed.
  However, I wanted to utilize concepts from my previous pieces using non-overlapping points.
  I ended up laying several of the same design, with slight jitter and variations so fill in extra space.
  The color scheme and design was inspired by a landscape photo I saw, though of course it's been shifted quite a bit in the artistic process.
  This is yet another piece where the texture was as, or more, interesting to me than any other aspect.

  Tyler Hobbes is obviously an amazing artist.
  While I was appreciating one of his pieces the other day,
  I realized how his use of negative space in flow fields creates a really distinct texture for a piece.
  Many flow field algorithms will produce lines that overlap and intersect at various places.
  That can be a great look, but creating negative space between lines (or in this case, points)
  can really emphasis certain aspects of the flow field and draw attention to different details.
  I used the same pointillism code that I used in my previous post but used an orbital flow field
  algorithm I developed a few months ago to create a pointillism flow field that I was really pleased with.
  It's always fun when a piece has so many good variations that it's hard to pick a final few renderings.
  This was just such a piece!!

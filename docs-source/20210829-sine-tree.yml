  I haven't had much time recently to make art.
  I had an idea for a simple recursion tree that uses sine waves instead of straight lines for the branches,
  with each recursion becoming slightly more dampened.
  I used a quad tree to do some collision checking (though it isn't perfect),
  and assigned colors based on how far down the tree the branch was.
  I scaled the thickness of the branch so that each would start slightly thicker than it ended.
  I like this effect because it reminded me of how real trees tend to end.
  The overall effect kind of reminds me of a river delta.

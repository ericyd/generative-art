  Wobbly function day.
  <br>
  <a href="https://piterpasma.nl/articles/wobbly">Wobbly Functions</a> (article updated 2024/01/13!!) are a name I've given to smoothly undulating formulas made from modulated sine waves. Usually it's formulas of the form:
  <br>
  <pre>sin(a * b + c + d * sin(e * f + g)) + sin(h * i + j + k * sin(l * m + n)) + ...</pre>
  <br>
  Or something along those lines. Donâ€™t worry about angles or trigonometric identities, just go with the wobble!

  Interestingly, I had an idea very similar to this before I read this prompt or article!

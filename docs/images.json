I realized that differential line growth has a similar form to meandering river systems, and I wanted to see how close I could get to a convincing meandering river interpretation. I wasn't able to fully dial in the 'river' look I was going for, but I was happy with the result nonetheless. My algorithm began as a copy/paste from <a href='http://www.codeplastic.com/2017/07/22/differential-line-growth-with-processing/' target='_blank'>this example on codeplastic.com</a>, and I was also inspired by <a href='https://inconvergent.net/generative/differential-line/' target='_blank'>this example on inconvergent.net</a>.

      "description": "Tyler Hobbes is obviously an amazing artist. While I was appreciating one of his pieces the other day, I realized how his use of negative space in flow fields creates a really distinct texture for a piece. Many flow field algorithms will produce lines that overlap and intersect at various places. That can be a great look, but creating negative space between lines (or in this case, points) can really emphasis certain aspects of the flow field and draw attention to different details. I used the same pointillism code that I used in my previous post but used an orbital flow field algorithm I developed a few months ago to create a pointillism flow field that I was really pleased with. It's always fun when a piece has so many good variations that it's hard to pick a final few renderings. This was just such a piece!!",

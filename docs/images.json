While I was appreciating one of his pieces the other day, I realized how his use of negative space in flow fields creates a really distinct texture for a piece. Many flow field algorithms will produce lines that overlap and intersect at various places. That can be a great look, but creating negative space between lines (or in this case, points) can really emphasis certain aspects of the flow field and draw attention to different details. I used the same pointillism code that I used in my previous post but used an orbital flow field algorithm I developed a few months ago to create a pointillism flow field that I was really pleased with. It's always fun when a piece has so many good variations that it's hard to pick a final few renderings.

It feels so stark and powerful, yet it uses really simple principles that I've used in many other drawings. The only real difference is the noise algorithm that is used to calculate the flow field.

However, they all use essentially the same process and very similar algorithms so I bundled it into a single series.
